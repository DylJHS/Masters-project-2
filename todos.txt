To Do


URGENT: 
- STACK the models
- Select the gamma for each of the features in the regression models
- Run the hyperprameter tuning for the categorical models on the hpc using the weighted data 
- Figure out what the baseline model is (always predicts normal claass or follows the class frequency frequencies randomly)

- Remove the cancer types with less than 150 samples
- Loop over the different cancer types and tune the hyperparameters 
- Create a model based on each type 

- Once the parameters and hyperparameters are set train the full model on the train data 
- Test on the validation/test data 
- Visualise the model performance by visualising the loss vs the epochs for each feature

To Do


URGENT: 

1. STACK the models
- Need to repeat the entire pipeline for the specific cancer types with more than 300 samples

- Write the training script for the full model

- Load the full RNA data to the hpc so that i can create the cancer_specific data sets in all formats (log, scaled ...)

- Need to create the cancer specific hyperparameters
- Need the cancer-specific class weights



- Figure out what the baseline model is (always predicts normal claass or follows the class frequency frequencies randomly)

- Remove the cancer types with less than 300 samples
- Loop over the different cancer types and tune the hyperparameters 
- Create a model based on each type 

- Once the parameters and hyperparameters are set train the full model on the train data 
- Test on the validation/test data 
- Visualise the model performance by visualising the loss vs the epochs for each feature


- Give Marit the data sets if she does not already have them

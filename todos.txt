To Do


URGENT: 

1. STACK the models
- Tune the meta learner hyperparams on the meta learner train set
- Need to repeat the entire pipeline for the specific cancer types with more than 300 samples

- Figure out what the baseline model is (always predicts normal claass or follows the class frequency frequencies randomly)

- Remove the cancer types with less than 300 samples
- Loop over the different cancer types and tune the hyperparameters 
- Create a model based on each type 

- Once the parameters and hyperparameters are set train the full model on the train data 
- Test on the validation/test data 
- Visualise the model performance by visualising the loss vs the epochs for each feature


- Give Marit the data sets if she does not already have them

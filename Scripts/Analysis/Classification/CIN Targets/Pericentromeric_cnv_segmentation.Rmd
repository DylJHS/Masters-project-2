## Load the libraries

Import the data
```{r}

Create the pericentromeric regions by combining the adjacent gbh (gamma, beta, HSat satellite) regions which can be gaped by centromeric transition (ct) regions and selecting the longest contiguous pericentromeric region as well as any additional pericentromeric ranges that are beyond a certain threshold

```{r}
# from the T2T data select the ranges for the annotations of satellites that correspond to pericentromeric sats 

cgbh_segs <- all_segs %>% 
  filter(!(grepl("^hor.*L\\)$", name)) &
           !(grepl("rDNA", name))) %>% 
  dplyr::select(c("seqnames","start", "end", "width", "name")) %>% 
  arrange(seqnames, start)

# Combine the adjacent ranges
comb_cgbh <- cgbh_segs %>%
  group_by(seqnames) %>%
  arrange(start) %>%
  mutate(end_next = lead(start),
         combined = ifelse(end == end_next & !is.na(end_next), TRUE, FALSE),
         combined_group = 0) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-"end_next") %>% 
  arrange(seqnames, start )

cgbh_subset <- comb_cgbh %>%
  group_by(seqnames) %>%
  mutate(first_hsat = cummax(grepl("hsat", name)),
         last_hsat = rev(cummax(rev(grepl("hsat", name))))) %>%
  filter((first_hsat == 1) & (last_hsat == 1)) %>%
  dplyr::select(-c("first_hsat","last_hsat")) %>%
  ungroup()

for (i in 2:nrow(cgbh_subset)) {
  cgbh_subset$combined_group[i] <- ifelse(
    cgbh_subset$combined[i - 1],
    cgbh_subset$combined_group[i - 1],
    cgbh_subset$combined_group[i - 1] + 1
  )
}

# Ensuring that the resulting combined regions start and end with HSat regions
adj_cgbh <- cgbh_subset %>%
  group_by(seqnames, combined_group) %>%
  mutate(first_hsat = cummax(grepl("hsat", name)),
         last_hsat = rev(cummax(rev(grepl("hsat", name))))) %>% 
  filter((first_hsat == 1) & (last_hsat == 1)) %>%
  dplyr::select(-c("first_hsat","last_hsat")) %>%
  summarise(start_bp = dplyr::first(start),
            end_bp = last(end),

final_cgbh <- adj_cgbh %>%

  mutate(
    peri_id = case_when(
      n() > 1 ~ paste0("peri_", substring(as.character(seqnames), 4, nchar(as.character(seqnames))), "_", row_number()),
      TRUE ~ paste0("peri_", substring(as.character(seqnames), 4, nchar(as.character(seqnames))))),
      seqnames = substring(as.character(seqnames), 4, nchar(as.character(seqnames)))
    ) %>% 
  rename(seqnames = "chromosome") %>% 
  dplyr::select(peri_id,chromosome, everything())
  
print(final_cgbh)

# write.csv(final_cgbh,"/Users/Dyll/Documents/Education/VU_UVA/Internship/Epigenetics/Janssen_Group-UMCUtrecht/Main_Project/Data/Other/alpha_incl_all_pericentro_meta.csv", row.names = FALSE)

Length-limited Alpha Included conclusion: the above yields 25 pericentromeric regions across all chromosomes. The chromosomes that do not have any pericentromeric regions assigned to them include chromosomes 6,11, 12, 18 & 19, which seems to add up with what is seen in the genome viewer as well as what has been reported by Altmose (2022). The chromosomes which display more than a single elongated pericentromeric region include chromosomes:
- 13 with 2
- 15 with 2
- 16 with 2
- 21 with 2
- 22 with 3
- Y with 2




V. Reconfigure the segmented copy number data in terms of the newly defined pericentromeric data
```{r}
cnv_long <- data.frame()
for (chrm in unique(ori_segmnt_cnv$chr)){ # Loop over the chromosomes that have pericentromeric regions
  if (!chrm %in% final_cgbh$chromosome){
    next
  } else {
    check_sub <- final_cgbh %>% 
      filter(chromosome == chrm)
    seg_sub <- ori_segmnt_cnv %>%
      filter(chr == chrm) %>%
      expand_grid(check_sub) %>%
      filter(
        (start >= start_bp & start < end_bp) |
          (end > start_bp & end <= end_bp) |
          (start <= start_bp & end >= end_bp)
      ) %>%
      mutate( # Calculate the overlap betweent the cnv segments and pericentromeric regions
        overlap_start = pmax(start, start_bp),
        overlap_end = pmin(end, end_bp),
        overlap_length = overlap_end - overlap_start,
        check_sub_length = end_bp - start_bp,
        overlap_proportion = overlap_length / check_sub_length
      ) %>%
      group_by(peri_id, sampleID) %>% 
      summarise( # Calculate overlap-weighted mean copy number for each sample's pericentromeric range
        cnv = round(sum(value * overlap_proportion) / sum(overlap_proportion),4),
        overlap_segs = n(),
        mean_overlap = mean(overlap_proportion),
        .groups = 'drop'  # This option removes the grouping structure after summation
      ) %>% 
      dplyr::select(sampleID, peri_id, cnv, mean_overlap ,overlap_segs)
  }
  cnv_long <- rbind(cnv_long, seg_sub)
}


# Distribution of the number of cnv segments (overlap_segs) that get mapped (overlap) to each pericentromeric region across all samples. Most overlap to only 1 segment. 

sample_count_frequencies <- cnv_long %>%
  group_by(overlap_segs) %>%
  summarise(number = n(), 
            ,.groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate(pcnt =paste0( round(number/sum(.$number)*100,3),"%"))


```

Restructure the data to get the desired output:
The average cnv value that is present within each pericentromeric region (columns)
across all samples (rows)

```{r}

cnv_reformat <- pivot_wider(cnv_long %>% 
                              dplyr::select(sampleID, peri_id, cnv),
                            names_from = peri_id, values_from = cnv)
cnv_reformat[is.na(cnv_reformat)] <- 0
  

# write.csv(cnv_reformat, "/Users/Dyll/Documents/Education/VU_UVA/Internship/Epigenetics/Janssen_Group-UMCUtrecht/Main_Project/Data/CIN_Features/CNV_Data/unlim_alpha_incl_TCGA_pericentro_cnv.csv", 
#           row.names = FALSE)
```

Length-limited alpha included CNV mapped conclusion: 
- 14 regions are able to get mapped to certain cnvs that are present in the data

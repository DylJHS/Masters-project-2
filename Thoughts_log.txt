Thinking about editting the SoI-to-Control-set Wilcoxon Signed Rank test so as to become directional
I may not be able to use the wilcoxon paired test between the SoI and the control sets due the distribution of the difference between the two not being symmetrical around the median. This is because the skeweness of both are the opposite of each other. 
Thinking about intialising a permutation test instead of the Wilcoxon test between the two sets for each control set
Can't use DESeq2 for the paired analysis unless i switch datasets, as it only takes raw RNA-seq counts as input

Creating a preanalysis file for the exploratory analysis the set of interest
started to set up the Contrast analysis to test the SoI-to-Control_set pairings individually
 Should forget the coontrast test given that it might just add complexity to the analysis as opposed to clarifying. Also the result that showed that each of the control sets does deviate significantly from the general trend. Not what I wanted but was confirmed by Adi that this is most likely to be expected given that I am dealing with cancer cells
Finished the Contrast Analysis, the result showed significant difference among the Set pairings (not what i wanted). But can move on. 


05/01/24

Starting to create the permutation paired test in the RNA_Analysis script
Reading up on the Fisher-Pitman permutation test
Considered adding a test for equality of variance following the permutation test, test aren't meant to handle paired data (ex: Levene's). So Choosing to display the variance among the pairings instead as is shown by the violin plots (similarity of widths) in Q1.A
 Making the test one-sided in order to reinforce the interpretation of the analysis
Finished the one-sided paired permutation test between the SoI and Control Set for each Set
Edited the RNA_Analysis to use the same control sets that are used in the charts to maintain a sense of consistency across the analysis


06/01/24


 going to start implementing the changes to the RNA_Analysis to the CNV Analysis
 Changes that will need to be made to the graphs in the script include:
- Converting the names of the samples/pairings on the x axes
- Finding the best colour palettes for the differences by tumour type
- Adding significant p-value indicators to the plots
- Making sure the plots are as understandable as possible

Editing the RNA_Analysis Q2.C to apply a one-sided paired permutation test between the SoI and the control sets when grouping by TSS
And therefore also removing the paired t.test that was in the Analysis previously


07/01/24

- Need to finish the RNA_Analysis up to the point that i can and then convert it for use with the CNV data as well

- Reading up on the multiple correction methods that might be best suited for the paired tests. 
- The type of test is caught between the BH method (large # of tests) & the BY method (as can't truly address the correlation between the tests, or if any are present)
- Likely to go with the BH method unless proven that there are dependencies between the tests
- Should consider switching from one-sided tests to two-sided as the assumption that the SoI showed as general higher expression than other genes was made after seeing the data. 
- Two-sided tests are a bit more conservative
- My initial hypothesis is that these genes show a differential epxression pattern as opposed to solely a higher one
- So switching the tests to two-sided
- Changing the test in Q1.D so that it is not only two-sided but also corrected for using the BH method
- Edited the script in RNA_Analysis Part II in order to upload the entire dataset for the selected control set instead of using filtering the concatenated one
- The use of the full (only selected ~2000 rows of the 11000) allows for better analyses using more of the data
- Need to explore the data some more to check the number of samples for each cancer type and other such analyses that will help determine the types of tests that i can perform
- Should do the above using the Pre_Analysis script 
- All the paired tests grouping by cnacer types come back as siginificant with a pvlaue of 0 for all. This means that plotting them as i had in the previous version won't produce a highly discernable graph as all the points will appear on the same line
- I will use a barplot instead to show the average differential expression by cancer type (TSS) 
- Will also produce the same graph as before on 2 axes but using the diff expression vs the dif copy number once the copy number analysis is achieved
- Broke down the graph in Q2.A into facets based on the TSS group as opposed ot using colour palettes as there are not sufficient colours to cover each type
- Split the RNA_Analysis into 2 separate files for Part I and  Part II
- Created a barploot of the average differences in SoI vs Control Set for each TSS
 

08/01/24

- Editing the Notes file for the Project part I
- Added the interpretation to the mean TSS expression barplot (Q2.D)

- Edited the RNA_Analysis script to replace the 'Differential' terms with 'Difference'
- Considering changing the metric from Difference when assissing the differnces in expression levels to Fold Change (ratio). This might be easier for interpretation given familiarity and removes the factor of the unit seeing as it is solely a relative (comparative) metric, which makes sense for the analyses at hand

- Reading the documetation on the CNV data generated using the GISTIC2.0 method
- Data is represented using log2 ratios
- Positive values indicate a gain in copy number. For instance, a log2 ratio of 1 would suggest a doubling (2^1 = 2) of the copy number in the test sample compared to the reference.
- Negative values indicate a loss in copy number. For example, a log2 ratio of -1 would suggest a halving (2^-1 = 0.5) of the copy number.


09/01/24

- Created the CNV pre-analysis Rmd script
- Analysis of the distribution of the CNV data

- Looking at the distribution of the CNV log2 ratios both the SoI and the Control Sets
- Looking at the distribution of the difference in the CNV values between the sets
- Leaving the RNA units untouched and using the difference in the comparison might be more valuable than assessing the ratio (FC) since I am assessing the sets of different genes and therefore the baseline expression in a ratio wouldn't make much sense
- Think about using tests of variance to show the spread of the data in each of the groupings that get applied
- Creating a Notes for the Part I of the analyses on the CNV data


10/01/24

- Configuring the CNV Analysis past Question 2
- Editing the graphs in both CNV and RNA analysis

- Finish updating the CNV analysis
- update the graphs in the RNA analysis (significance bars)

- Write down the remarks/questions for Stefan (PPI database pull down cutoff, Permutation tests, negative binomial in the RNA-seq data, differnetial analysis on differnet genes)



11/01/24

- Update the graphs in the RNA analysis
- try to implement some form of PCA 
- Or combine the graphs from the 2 analyses in some way
- Based on the meaning of the interaction score, it might be prudent to set a higher interaction cutoff
- meet with Theo. Advised to renormalise the data 
- should it be normalised per set (SoI & control) or across both (i.e. using the vlaues across both sets as the normalisation parameter)
- Writing the rundown of the presentation
- In order to figure out how to re-normalise the data, figure out how it was normalised in the first place. 
- Was it across rows (samples) or columns (genes) or something different 


12/01/24

- Writing the Rundown for the presentation
- Writing the script for the presentation


13/01/24

- Writing the script for the presentation
- Constructing the Slides for the presentation
- Created a Notes file for the Main Literature References that will be used in my report(s)/presentations



14/01/24

- Using Whimsical for presentation pipeline diagram

- Whimsical is a scam


15/01/24

- Finished the presentation 
- Presented to the Lens & Janssen group


16/01/24

- My Anh's PhD Defense
- Reading up on the different methods for RNASeq normlisation (within&between samples & datasets)


17/01/24

- find out if re-normalisation is truly worth it

- Thinking of not normalising for the inter-set comparison
- But normalising for the intra-set analyses


18/01/24

- Starting the process of figuring out how to renormalise the set-of-interest subset


- Starting on the next Part of the Project (part II)
- Need to cut down the data to the set of interest only while renormalising the data


- In terms of the re-normalisation of the subset of genes it may no longer be a good idea. The process of normalising the data would average out some of the characteristics of the genes in the sample which may not be the best in terms of interpretaiton due to the fact that my hypothesis presumes that the genes in this set are distinct from the rest of the genome. Therefore even an average gene expression in this set could be indicative of something on a wider scale. Also the set is overexpressed when compared to the rest of the genome so lower expressed genes would not appear more like the rest of the genome but would show up as distinct on the lower side. 


- Talk with Stefan
- The iteration testing for the expression data was 'Overkill'
- Only showed what was expected in the most difficult way possible
- The genes of interest are likely just on the higher end of the overall expression histogram
- Using a normal control would prove more evident as that would show that there is a differnece in the expected expression (normal vs cancerous)
- Moving forward suggested to:
- Correlate the genes within the subset to determine if there are genes that are covariates of one-another
- These correlated genes can then be grouped based on a z-score based signature 
- Signature can then be used for further analyses


- Talk did not go well, under the impression that my project is far too simple and convoluted than it should be
- Need to Organise the workflow better
- plan and determine which analyses to implement and why each one of them is beneficial and what they provide individual (i.e. what their purpose is)
- You are only using PanCan data so need to give extra thought to the meaning of the analyses that you are performing 
- Getting a healthy control set would be beneficial to the project as it would provide some basis for the normal functioning of the data that you are looking at

- Was also mentioned that STRING is likely not the best way to go about expanding the list of genes
- Would be more accurate to expand based on specific experimental data from select researchers

- Was slightly condescending
- Think more about finding other resources to assist you or give you suggestions

- Started writing the Gene_Subset_Analyis.Rmd which will contain the analyses for the correlations and the gene signature creation


19/01/24

- Continuing the Correlation analysis

- found a potential dataset for healthy data from different tissue types from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE120795
- Saved as 'GSE120795_norm_counts_TPM_GRCh38.p13_NCBI.tsv' in the Raw_Data folder
- Copied and saved as 'Healthy_Data' in the RNA_Data folder 
- Data in only composed of RNAseq data 
- The values are normalised using TPM
- Also added the dataset for the values in their raw count form 
- Saved as 'GSE120795_raw_counts_GRCh38.p13_NCBI.tsv.gz' in the Raw_Data folder
- Copied and saved as 'Healthy_Data_raw_counts' in the RNA_Data folder 

- Reading up on GREAT at 'http://great.stanford.edu/public/html/splash.php' 
- This tool may not be relevatn conerning the work that i am doing as it focuses on the cis regulatory regions of the input regions
- Returns the annotation terms that re significanlty associated with the input regions/genes and their cis elements
- My focus is on the gene/regions themselves already knowing the function of most of the genes

- Recall that Stefan also mentioned a means of clustering such as k-means

- Correlated the RNA data using a Pearson correlation score (not measuring the distances but the similarity between the genes)
- Creating a heatmap for the correlation matrix
- Using Bioconductor's 'ComplexHeatmap' package
- 307*307 genes makes for a large matrix
- would like to turn it into a triangle plot seeing as the plot is symmetrical across the diagonal half the plot is redundant

- Would like to follow up the correlation matrix and test using a PCA to identfy the clusters with more precision, create the signature genes and use those signatures as variables instead of the original list of genes which is quite long

- Created the same Correlation analysis file but for the CNV instead of the RNA data
- This seems like it might be the better approach as it comes from the CIN trait (CNV) back to the genetic trait as opposed to grouping by the RNA expression level and then trying to identify specific sets of genes for each 
- This way i am starting from the characteristic that I am interested in, CIN, and grouping at this level in order to identify traits that might be shared by different genes 
- Starting off with the CNV and then adding other CIN metrics to this in order to gain insight

- Need to find a way to break apart the different groupings in the clustermap 
- This will hopefully give me the individual genes that make up each of the groups


20/01/24


- Trying to find ways to extract the relevant clusters from the clusterplot

- Transforming the correlation map into a distance map

- Slightly confused about how the process will work so here is the rundown of how i see it:
- Create CNV signatures. These signatures are created based on the correlation between the CNVs that are observed in different genes within the data. The genes that are closely related based on the distance matrix (ex: 1 - Pearson's coef) are grouped together using a method such as k-means. 
- Each group makes up a CNV signature. 


21/01/24

- Might be useful to consider different clustering methods
- K-means clustering based on the Pearson correlation, but also others such as Mutual Information / Entropy
- Reading up on the methods for correlating RNA and feature extraction
- Thinking that using a Mutual information as the basis for the signatures could be beneficial due to the non-linearity of some of the relation


22/01/24

- Reading up more on the Mutual Information approach and the use of Spline functions to estimate RNA distributions
- Reading up on other features that could be added to the CIN set 
- Such as the HRD (Homologous Recombination Deficiency), hrd-loh, ai1 & lst1 Scores which are available on the XenaBrowser 

- Going to start with using Pearson's correlation as the basis of the RNA & CNV signatures
- Will then move on to using Mutual Information or another method
- And will increase the features for the CIN variables 

- Changing the distance measure for the CNV to euclidean is likely better
- This is because when dealing with Copy Number there is more than just directional changes that matter

- Created one distance matrix based on the Pearson and another based on the Euclidean distance
- finding a way to select the optimal number of groups using the k-means method
- Using the Silhouette method
- The Silhouette method does not show the best divisions between the groups when using k-means with the Pearson distance as well as the Euclidean distance
- The Silhouette score for both shows maximal at 2 clusters 
- Creating 2 broad CNV signatures does not seem effective for the purpose of extracting features from the variable
- Will likely have to implement a different clustering method (MI, Entropy ...) sooner than expected


23/01/24

- Emailing Reza about the updates to the Project and the Interim presentation


24/01/24

- Might be a good idea to remove genes that have NA values across any type of cancer for both the expression and the CNA data

 
- Might be thinking about this wrong
- Should i only be using the expression data of the genes of interest
- and then the CIN data (CNV and such) for the rest of the entire genome
- Instead of CIN data for only the genes of interest as well
- This is because i expect that a change in the regulation of the genes of interest is responsible for CIN in the LAD domains
- These LAD domains contain chromatin that is not related ot the sequences for the genes of interest
- I need to associate the expression patterns of the genes of interest to CIN signs (SV, Micronuclei, CNV) throughout the nucleus or specifically at LAD regions
- Can find specific sequences of cLADs to look at the issue at LAD specific regions
- Or gather as much CIN data about the samples as possible

- Can continue with the Pearson/euclidean/MI distance clustering 
- But base it only on the expression data not on the CNV data
- to get the expression patterns/signatures

- I want to relate the expression changes to changes in CIN data
- Need to perform clustering grouping such as i've been doing with the CNVs but using the entire genome data as opposed to solely the SoI
- Using this data that is genome wide and the patterns/signatures generated from this 
- Would like to relate it back to expression patterns in the Set of Interest (using either signatures/groupings or individual genes)

- Can do the above by creating two sets of signatures
- One that is/are expression signatures based solely on the expression patterns of the set of interest 
- Another that is/are CIN signatures that are based on the CIN data from the genome as a whole 
- Can also try to limit the CIN data to cLAD specific regions
 
- redownloaded the PanCan data as it somehow disappeared from the Raw_Data folder
- The data that was redownloaded includes RNA & CNV across multiple forms (SNP6, before and after germline removal, raw & norm counts...) 
- The data also includes the other data that refers to different datatypes (HDR signatures, survival info, phenotypes...) 

 
- Need to reformat the CNV data for the full genome data. Not sure if i should only use the after germline removal or the before as well. Will default to the post-removal


25/01/24

- Meeting with Aniek & Adi
- Need to integrate the Healthy RNAseq into the Analysis
- Forgot to mention about the Interim report that also needs to be written for the presentation

- Following up on the Healthy dataset by the Russian Academy of Sciences
- Looking through the list of cited by articles, looks to be cited by various papers
- Reliability of the data is a bit better given the citations
- Also found the citation to another dataset within the GTExPortal website
- This set may be better due to extensive number of samples and tissue sources 

- The GTEx Dataset (V8) has over 17000 samples 
- From 948 Donors
- Covering 54 Tissue types
- The healthy status of the donor is determined by the Death hardy Scale (DTHHRDY) which ranges from 0-4
- Only the 0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd cases should satisfy your analysis
- The TPM RNA data that was downloaded was normalised for within sample variation (transcript length & seq depth)
- None of the data was normalised for a within Dataset normalisation
- Need to do that first applying either Quantile or TMM normalisation methods

- Back to reformatting the CNV data to incorporate the full genome data as opposed to only the set of interest

- Attended Marieke Oudelaar's seminar at Hubrecht 
- Went for the 3C and other chromatin conformation capturing techniques

- Met Lucia Barbadilla while I was there, she was speaking with Adi
- Would like to meet her again to get her input on some of the analyses

- Reza messaged me back
- Wants to have the presentation on the 16th of Feb 
- At VU
- Can do zoom for Aniek or Adi if cannot attend
- Need to send slides ahead of time
- NEED TO WRITE THE INTERIM REPORT
- presentation at around 2pm

 
26/01/24

- finish transforming the dataset with the CNVs for the full set
- The transformation is taking a long time due to the size of the dataset

- Handling the GTEx Healthy Set creation and preprocessing at the same time due to the time constraints imposed by the size of the datasets

- Created the csv file for the full CNV datatset
- Creating the csv file for the full GTEx dataset

- Downloaded and using the annotation file to identify samples (subjects) that need to be removed from the dataset
 
- Using Dask to clean/preprocess the GTEx dataset
- Using the values from the DTHHRDY variable in the meta data to remove the unhealthy samples from the full GTEx RNA dataset
- Values of 1-3 (exclude 0 and 4) are kept and considered healthy

- Using the Samples that come from the sources other than diseased (cancer...) cases
- Using the ventilator (0) cases as well as there is no indication that these subjects had a disease such as cancer prior to death
- In total this adds up to 842 distinct subjects
- End up with around 10,000 samples for healthy set


 27/01/24

- Continuing with the GTEx Healthy Samples Dataframe creation

- Saved the Healthy RNA GTEx samples in multiple files in the GTEx_RNA_Healthy folder in the RNA_Data folder
- Still need to normalise the samples for within dataset effects (TMM or quantile) 
- 
- TMM is the likely option 
- This method would work due to the fact that the Samples are assumed to be from healthy individuals and not differentially expressed
- Created the usable CSV file for the count data as the DESeq2 only uses count data and not pre-normalised
- Once the data file for the count GTEx RNA data is created, will go through the preprocessing to remove the unwanted (unhealthy) samples
- Using GPT to translate the python processing script to R seeing as there is no DESeq2 python package

- Might be a good idea to translate the other scripts that were written in python over to R for improved consistency and overall readability




28/01/24

- Editing the GTEx csv file so that it does not contain an index when read into R script
- For comparing the healthy samples to the cancerous ones likely to need ot apply a DGE analysis
- Will need to use the raw counts for this 
- Will also need to use DESeq2 library
- Should not normalise the counts for this
- Need to make sure that the genes are the smae across datasets (i.e. remove the genes that are not common across datasets)
- Need to merge the datasets based on teh common genes
- Need to ensure that the gene names are standardised across sets

- First want to put the healthy dataset through the same analysis that was done with TCGA dataset
- This will enable me to determine whether the genes of interest are differentially expressed in a healthy sample as well
- A DGE alone would only allow me to determine whether the genes are differentially expressed/regulated between cancer and healthy
- It would not allow me to determine if the difference between the control sets and SOI is also observed in healthy samples or not
- Need to do a TMM normalisation of the GTEx data for this part
- Actually keeping the values as TPM may be best for this part as the samples are not assumed to be differentially expressed and they are all from the same library therefore even though there are batch effects this is of no concern given that the interest is between genes
- Will be concerned with this later on though when comparing between samples and cancer types
- May have to remove the samples with RIN < 6 as they are considered unsuitable for RNA analyses
- Therefore downloaded the dataset wich contains this meta data
- This will also be useful for the DGE and intraset comparisons for batch effect normalisation
 
- Something to add to the tests that I have done in Part I of the project is that I was calculating the average expression values using the logs which means that I was calculating the geometric averages which are less prone to skewness by highly or lowly expressed genes
 
- I also need to figure out the GTEx sample labels based on the tissue type that they represent
- I need to reduce the genes in the GTEx dataset to the same ones that are in the TCGA dataset

Thinking about editting the SoI-to-Control-set Wilcoxon Signed Rank test so as to become directional
I may not be able to use the wilcoxon paired test between the SoI and the control sets due the distribution of the difference between the two not being symmetrical around the median. This is because the skeweness of both are the opposite of each other. 
Thinking about intialising a permutation test instead of the Wilcoxon test between the two sets for each control set
Can't use DESeq2 for the paired analysis unless i switch datasets, as it only takes raw RNA-seq counts as input

Creating a preanalysis file for the exploratory analysis the set of interest
started to set up the Contrast analysis to test the SoI-to-Control_set pairings individually
 Should forget the coontrast test given that it might just add complexity to the analysis as opposed to clarifying. Also the result that showed that each of the control sets does deviate significantly from the general trend. Not what I wanted but was confirmed by Adi that this is most likely to be expected given that I am dealing with cancer cells
Finished the Contrast Analysis, the result showed significant difference among the Set pairings (not what i wanted). But can move on.

Starting to create the permutation paired test in the RNA_Analysis script
Reading up on the Fisher-Pitman permutation test
Considered adding a test for equality of variance following the permutation test, test aren't meant to handle paired data (ex: Levene's). So Choosing to display the variance among the pairings instead as is shown by the violin plots (similarity of widths) in Q1.A
 Making the test one-sided in order to reinforce the interpretation of the analysis
Finished the one-sided paired permutation test between the SoI and Control Set for each Set
Edited the RNA_Analysis to use the same control sets that are used in the charts to maintain a sense of consistency across the analysis

 going to start implementing the changes to the RNA_Analysis to the CNV Analysis
 Changes that will need to be made to the graphs in the script include:
- Converting the names of the samples/pairings on the x axes
- Finding the best colour palettes for the differences by tumour type
- Adding significant p-value indicators to the plots
- Making sure the plots are as understandable as possible

Editing the RNA_Analysis Q2.C to apply a one-sided paired permutation test between the SoI and the control sets when grouping by TSS
And therefore also removing the paired t.test that was in the Analysis previously

- Need to finish the RNA_Analysis up to the point that i can and then convert it for use with the CNV data as well

- Reading up on the multiple correction methods that might be best suited for the paired tests. 
- The type of test is caught between the BH method (large # of tests) & the BY method (as can't truly address the correlation between the tests, or if any are present)
- Likely to go with the BH method unless proven that there are dependencies between the tests
- Should consider switching from one-sided tests to two-sided as the assumption that the SoI showed as general higher expression than other genes was made after seeing the data. 
- Two-sided tests are a bit more conservative
- My initial hypothesis is that these genes show a differential epxression pattern as opposed to solely a higher one
- So switching the tests to two-sided
- Changing the test in Q1.D so that it is not only two-sided but also corrected for using the BH method
- Edited the script in RNA_Analysis Part II in order to upload the entire dataset for the selected control set instead of using filtering the concatenated one
- The use of the full (only selected ~2000 rows of the 11000) allows for better analyses using more of the data
-Need to explore the data some more to check the number of samples for each cancer type and other such analyses that will help determine the types of tests that i can perform
- Should do the above using the Pre_Analysis script 
- All the paired tests grouping by cnacer types come back as siginificant with a pvlaue of 0 for all. This means that plotting them as i had in the previous version won't produce a highly discernable graph as all the points will appear on the same line
- I will use a barplot instead to show the average differential expression by cancer type (TSS) 
- Will also produce the same graph as before on 2 axes but using the diff expression vs the dif copy number once the copy number analysis is achieved
- Broke down the graph in Q2.A into facets based on the TSS group as opposed ot using colour palettes as there are not sufficient colours to cover each type
- Split the RNA_Analysis into 2 separate files for Part I and  Part II
- Created a barploot of the average differences in SoI vs Control Set for each TSS

02/01/24:

Log:
- Configured the plots in Q2.A & B of the RNA_analysis_longer top handle the script following the changes for the multiple control sets.
- Edited the RNA_Analysis_longer script to maintain the same control set (for sole use) following the demonstration that the control sets all demonstrate a similar expression pattern.
- Read up on the binomial distribution and differential gene expression analyses. 

Questions: 
Questions on the validity of the statistical tests given the count nature of the RNA-seq data. After normalisation is it appropriate to consider the data to be continuous and therefore use (non)parametric tests. Also the data still seems to be distributed like a negative binomial distribution. Are there other tests that should be used instead of non-parametric ones when comparing different genes or groups of genes to one another?

Remarks: 
- For the DGE analyses that will follow make sure to use the R packages (EdgeR, DESeq2) as they are fitted to handle the negative binomial distributed RNA-seq data. 
- When conducting the DGE find out how to configure it for data that has already been normalised and log transformed. 



03/01/24:

Log:
- Configured the RNA_Analysis_longer script to use a random set of rows from the csv in order to lighten the weight when running the statistical tests on the when still configuring the script. 
- Read up on the different methods to deal with dependent groupings of independent samples for statistical tests. 
- Started to implement a Contrast analysis following the Friedman test which will help demonstrate whether the SoI-Control-set difference pairings vary significantly from one another or if we can assume they all follow a general trend. This contrast analysis will be based on the paired wilcoxon signed Rank test given the non-normal (binomial) distribution of the data, using each pairing against the mean of the others for each pairing and accounting for multiple testing. 

Remarks:
- The Contrast Analysis is made slightly difficult due to the nature of the data. 



04/01/24

Log:
- Created a Contrast analysis to compare the SoI-Control-set difference pairings following the Friedman test to evaluate whether or not the parings all follow a similar general expression pattern. The Result however, demonstrated a significant difference in the pattern for most of the pairings. This is however what could have been expected given the cancerous nature of the samples and that creates variation in the control sets. This result does not impact the rest of the analysis as the differnece between the SoI and the controls all appear to significant (to be determined using a Permuation method) and in the same direction.
- Created a Pre-Analysis R file to handle the pre analysis/visualisations of the SoI.
- Met with Adi to discuss the Presentation on the 15th of January. 

Remarks: 
- Need to move faster with the analyses (getting the sense that Adi is underwhelmed) 
- Need to finish the Permutation Test
- Need to start creating the slides for the presentation


 
05/01/24

Log:
- Implemented one-sided Paired permutation test in Q1.E between the SoI and the control set for each control group corrected using the Bonferroni correction
- Edited the script to use the same control sets for the graphics between sections

Remarks: 
- Need to start creating the slides for the presentation
- Need to perform the same modifications for the CNV analysis



06/01/24

Log:
- Edited the RNA_Analysis Q2.C. Applying a one-sided permutation test betweent he SoI and the Control set when grouping by TSS, therefore removing the paired t-test that was present before. 

Remarks:
Changes that will need to be made to the graphs in the script include:
- Converting the names of the samples/pairings on the x axes
- Finding the best colour palettes for the differences by tumour type
- Adding significant p-value indicators to the plots
- Making sure the plots are as understandable as possible



07/01/24

Log: 
- Switched the method of paired permutation from one-sided to two-sided due to bias after observing the data
- Edited the script in the Q2 to use the full control set dataset
- Applied the Benjamini-Hochberg method of multiple comparison correction due to the number of tests being applied and the assumption that there are no dependencies between the tests
- Used Facets in the Q2.A graph (expression difference across samples by TSS) instead of filling using colours due to the 33 groups which are slightly numerous
- Replaced the CEA pvalue vs mean dif expression plot with a barplot due to all TSS showing up as highly significant (pval < 0)
- Split the RNA_analysis into 2 Rmd files (Part I and II)

Remarks: 
- Still need to configure the CNV analysis 
- Will still use the CEA plot but combine CNV and RNA metrics into it instead of using pvalues as a variable



08/01/24

Log:
- Updated the Notes file for the experiments
- Updated the Interpretations of the figures
- Lit reading on CNV based analysis and the GISTIC2.0 documentation

Remarks:
- Still need to finish updating the CNV Analysis script


09/01/24

Log:
- Created CNV pre-analysis Rmd for discovery analyses
- Completed Q1.A - Q1.E of Part I of the CNV analysis

Remarks: 
- Need to complete the Notes segment for the CNV analysis for Part I
- Test for the variance in the distributions of both the CNV and the RNA sets


10/01/24

Log:
- Configured the CNV Analysis past Question 2
- Edited the graphs in both CNV and RNA analysis
- Finished updating the CNV analysis
- Updated the graphs in the RNA analysis (significance bars)
- Wrote down the remarks/questions for Stefan (PPI database pull down cutoff, Permutation tests, negative binomial in the RNA-seq data, differential analysis on different genes)


11/01/24

Log:
- Updated graphs in the RNA analysis
- met with Theo. Advised to renormalise the data 
- should it be normalised per set (SoI & control) or across both (i.e. using the vlaues across both sets as the normalisation parameter)
- Writing the rundown of the presentation
- In order to figure out how to re-normalise the data, figure out how it was normalised in the first place. 
- Was it across rows (samples) or columns (genes) or something different
 
Remarks:
- try to implement some form of PCA 
- Or combine the graphs from the 2 analyses in some way
- Based on the meaning of the interaction score, it might be prudent to set a higher interaction cutoff

- Wrote the Rundown for the presentation
- Wrote the script for the presentation
